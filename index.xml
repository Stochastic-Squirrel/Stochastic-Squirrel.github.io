      <description>The word sláinte in Scottish Gaelic which means health. It is normally used in place of cheers. The word whiskey is actually a translation of a Gaelic phrase which means “water of life”.
Another thing associated with Scottish life is bagpipes. I am appreciative of the time I have spent here as I listen to the not-so-distant bagpipist hike up the same hill as me. This last year has exposed me to more cultures and ideas than what I ever thought was possible.</description>

      <description>Clustering of similar product items can help decision makers strategically plan product mixes which can affect overall business strategy. In this post, I go over how to group similar products together using data from an online events retailer.
The Technical GistDon’t “blindly” standardize/normalize features without thinking about what you are actually trying to convey with each feature. Sometimes it makes more sense to normalize row-wise.
If you value interpretability of clusters over all else, the features you engineer must make sense and come from hypotheses that you have formed from looking at the data.</description>

      <description>This post will deal with how to approach a problem using simulation. Furthermore, some theory on the distribution of order statistics shall be touched on as well as some very basic Queueing Theory concepts.
ContextSay you are trying to reach an international number. It can cost a fortune to reach an operator on the other side of the world. You have limited funds and you wish to simulate a call centre system to estimate how likely you are to reach an operator before you run out of money.</description>

      <description>Hi there! My name is Sean and you&#39;ve stumbled across my blog.
I&#39;ll be mostly posting about my side projects and things that I have learnt or find to be interesting. I don&#39;t presume to be an expert on anything, but I do enjoy my work. Consequently, I would like to excite people about the potential of these fields to help solve some of society&#39;s toughest problems.
My main goal with this blog is to explain things in such a way that people can take the key ideas and use them to help solve their own challenges.</description>

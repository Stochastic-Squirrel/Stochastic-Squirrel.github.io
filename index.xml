      <description>This post will deal with how to approach a problem using simulation. Furthermore, some theory on the distribution of order statistics shall be touched on as well as some very basic Queueing Theory concepts.
ContextSay you are trying to reach an international number. It can cost a fortune to reach an operator on the other side of the world. You have limited funds and you wish to simulate a call centre system to estimate how likely you are to reach an operator before you run out of money.</description>

      <description>Hi there! My name is Sean and you&#39;ve stumbled across my blog.
I&#39;ll be mostly posting about my side projects and things that I have learnt or find to be interesting. I don&#39;t presume to be an expert on anything, but I do enjoy my work. Consequently, I would like to excite people about the potential of these fields to help solve some of society&#39;s toughest problems.
My main goal with this blog is to explain things in such a way that people can take the key ideas and use them to help solve their own challenges.</description>

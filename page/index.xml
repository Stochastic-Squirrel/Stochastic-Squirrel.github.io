      <description>Hi there! My name is Sean and you&#39;ve stumbled across my blog.
I&#39;ll be mostly posting about my side projects and things that I have learnt or find to be interesting. I don&#39;t presume to be an expert on anything, but I do enjoy my work.
My interests predominantly lie in the practical application of statistics/machine learning to aid in decision making or for the creation of data-driven products.
Feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn if you would like to connect.</description>

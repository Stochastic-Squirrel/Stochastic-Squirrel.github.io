      <description>Hi there! My name is Sean and you&#39;ve stumbled across my blog.
I&#39;ll be mostly posting about my side projects and things that I have learnt or find to be interesting. I don&#39;t presume to be an expert on anything, but what I do know is that I have a deep love for the fields of Statistics and Data Science. Consequently, I would like to excite people about the potential of these fields to help solve some of society&#39;s toughest problems.</description>

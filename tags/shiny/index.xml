      <description>The word sláinte in Scottish Gaelic which means health. It is normally used in place of cheers. The word whiskey is actually a translation of a Gaelic phrase which means “water of life”.
Another thing associated with Scottish life is bagpipes. I am appreciative of the time I have spent here as I listen to the not-so-distant bagpipist hike up the same hill as me. This last year has exposed me to more cultures and ideas than what I ever thought was possible.</description>
